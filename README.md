# AI-Driven-Retention-Improvement-Case-Study

AI-Enabled First-Week Retention Strategy for a Streaming App

A 6-Week Product Case Study by Mohith Pulavarthi

Overview

This project explores why music/video streaming apps lose most new users within their first session and proposes a redesign of the onboarding and early experience to improve Week-1 retention.

Using assumed baseline metrics and first-principles reasoning, I analyzed the new-user journey, built a funnel, identified key retention drivers, and designed a set of product improvements. The project includes diagrams, wireframes, a structured experiment plan, and a 12-week execution roadmap.

Problem Statement

Most streaming apps struggle with early retention because the first session is:

generic

overwhelming

low in relevance

poor in activation

As a result:

only ~28–30% complete the first play

only ~25% perform a meaningful action (like, save, follow)

Day-1 return sits around ~22%

Week-1 retention drops to ~18%

Key Insights

Retention is determined in the first 10–20 minutes—not over weeks.

Personalization must start before the homepage (onboarding).

Activation is the strongest predictor of future retention.

Day-1 return is the most important habit-forming moment.

Core Product Solutions
1. Lightweight Taste Picker Onboarding

Fixes cold-start personalization and improves first-click relevance.

2. Activation-Focused First-Play Microflow

Guides users toward a meaningful action after their first play completion.

3. Personalized Day-1 Return Engine

Delivers a “come back tomorrow” trigger using micro-personalized playlists/prompts.

Experiment Plan

A single combined A/B test measuring:

First-click rate

First-play completion

Activation rate

Day-1 return

Week-1 retention (North Star Metric)

Expected improvements:
+10–15% first-click → +6–10% activation → +4–8 points Week-1 retention.

Execution Roadmap (12 Weeks)

Phase 1 (1–4): Research, assumptions, wireframes, flows

Phase 2 (5–8): Build MVP for onboarding, activation flow, return trigger

Phase 3 (9–12): A/B test, analyze, iterate, document learnings

Reflection

This project helped me deepen my understanding of retention, activation, experimentation, and how small early decisions define user outcomes.
